    "\n",
    "The **IPUMS CPS** dataset is derived from the U.S. Current Population Survey (CPS), which is a monthly survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) (link here: https://cps.ipums.org/cps/). \n",
    "The CPS collects data on employment, unemployment, earnings, demographics, and other social and economic factors. \n",

    "1. **Household-Level Data**: Contains information about the composition of households, housing characteristics, and household-level variables such as total income.\n",
    "2. **Person-Level Data**: Focuses on individual respondents, providing detailed information on demographic factors such as age, race, gender, and educational attainment.\n",
    "3. **Labor Force Data**: Records employment status, occupation, hours worked, and wage data for individuals. \n",

      "----------------\n",
      "\n",
      " ASECWTH is a household-level weight that should be used to generate statistics about households in March Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement data. The CPS uses a complex stratified sampling scheme, and ASECWTH must be used to produce unbiased household-level statistics from the IPUMS-CPS ASEC data. For analyses of non-ASEC data, researchers should use HWTFINL. For individual-level analyses, researchers should use WTFINL, ASECWT, or EARNWT. \n",
      "\n",
      "ASECWTH generally has the same value as WTSUPP for the household head or reference person. Vacant housing units and households that could not be interviewed due to residents' absence or refusal to participate have a value of zero in HWTSUPP; such sampled units were included in the public use CPS data beginning in 1988. \n",
      "\n",
      "Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two important points should be noted here. First, the lag between when the Census is conducted and when the CPS weights are updated is about 3 years. While the Census data are being processed, the CPS files are made available using the weighting scheme from the US Census prior to the latest Census. Second, once the files are updated, the old weights become obsolete and are replaced in the IPUMS data extract system. Published estimates from the lag years that use the old weights are not always updated. For example, 2010 poverty estimates were released in ASEC using the 2000 population controls. Once the 2010 population controls were made available, IPUMS-CPS replaced the ASEC 2010, 2011, and 2012 weights that are based on the 2000 population control with weights that are based on the 2010 population controls.\n",

      "----------------\n",
      "\n",
      " FOODSTMP indicates whether one or more members of the household received benefits from the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the prior year. This program is formerly known as the Food Stamps program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once such a household was identified, three follow-up questions were asked.  The first question determined the number of current household members covered by Food Stamps during the previous calendar year (STAMPNO).  The second question determined the number of months that Food Stamps were received during the previous year (STAMPMO).  Finally, a last question determined the total face value of Food Stamps received during that period (STAMPVAL).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Food Stamp Act of 1977 was enacted to increase the food purchasing power of eligible households through the use of coupons to purchase food. The Food and Nutrition Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers the Food Stamp Program through State and local welfare offices. The Food Stamp Program is the major national income support program which provides benefits to all low-income and low-resource households, regardless of the person's characteristics (e.g., sex, age, disability, etc.). The Food Stamps program was renamed SNAP as part of the Farm Bill of 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some variables relating to means-tested government assistance, including FOODSTMP, information was collected only from households whose estimated income fell below a given threshold.  During the first month that a household entered the survey, and one year later, the CPS interviewer asked the respondent to estimate the family's total income in the past twelve months, by choosing one of fourteen broad categories.  Only households in which the household members' combined income fell below a given level (e.g., under 30,000 dollars in the 1980s) were questioned about means-tested program benefits.  Households with estimated incomes above the threshold were presumed to neither qualify for nor receive such benefits, and were not asked these questions, to limit the length of interviews.  Households that were not questioned were coded as \"no\" for several variables relating to the receipt of means-tested benefits, including FOODSTMP.\n",

      "CPSIDP:\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "\n",
      " CPSIDP is an IPUMS CPS defined variable that uniquely identifies individuals across CPS samples. The first six digits of CPSIDP index the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. CPSIDP allows users to link a respondent appearing with a designated household roster line number (LINENO) across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSIDP value to this line number. CPSIDP will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MISH). In some cases, individuals will appear fewer than 8 times due to migration, mortality, non-response, and recording errors. Extensive documentation about the creation of CPSIDP is available elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Users should note that it is important to verify CPSIDP linkages with AGE, SEX, and RACE. In some cases CPSIDP will result in erroneous links, which are due to errors in the source data. Cases with the same CPSIDP value may also have inconsistent responses across samples due to errors on the part of the respondent or in recording the response. Ultimately, it is up to the individual researcher to determine the acceptability of the linkages made using CPSIDP. \n",
      "\n",
      "CPSIDP may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. \n",
      "\n",
      "To get started using CPSIDP, users may want to sort their data file by CPSIDP and MISH to create a person-time file. \n",
      "\n",
      "Users should take care when including the March Basic or ASEC as part of their linking. Respondents who are part of the ASEC oversample (as indicated by ASECOVERP) have a CPSIDP value of 0.

      "\n",
      "Researchers should use WTFINL rather than ASECWT when they wish to conduct person-level analyses of non-ASEC data. EARNWT should be used for any analysis including a small number of person-level variables (EARNWEEK, HOURWAGE, PAIDHOUR, and UNION). Researchers should use ASECWTH for household-level analyses. ASECWTCVD is available for the 2020 ASEC to adjust for nonrandom nonresponse resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

      "User Caution: For analyses that include the 2014 ASEC sample, please see the comparability tab.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ASEC CPS files include two groups of people who are not included in the production of published labor force statistics: (1) members of the armed services, and (2) members of the Hispanic oversample who were interviewed in months other than March. WTFINL and EARNWT assign these groups a value of 0. Both groups are assigned non-zero values in ASECWT.\n",
      "\n",
      "ASECWT is based on the inverse probability of selection into the sample and adjustments for the following factors: failure to obtain an interview; sampling within large sample units; the known distribution of the entire population according to age, sex, and race; over-sampling Hispanic persons; to give husbands and wives the same weight; and an additional step to provide consistency with labor force estimates from the basic survey. \n",

See LABFORCE for a dichotomous variable identifying whether a person participated in the labor force.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the CPS, individuals' employment status was determined on the basis of answers to a series of questions relating to their activities during the preceding week.  Those who reported doing any work at all for pay or profit, or working at least fifteen hours without pay in a family business or farm, were classified as \"at work.\"  Those who did not work during the previous week but who acknowledged having a job or business from which they were temporarily absent (e.g., due to illness, vacation, bad weather, or labor dispute) were also classified as employed, under the heading \"has job, not at work last week.\"\n",

      "Unemployed persons make up the third element of the labor force.  Individuals were coded as unemployed if they did no work for pay or profit, did not have a job from which they were briefly absent, and either reported looking for work as their major activity during the previous week (for 1962 through 1993) or answered yes to a question about whether they had been looking for work in the past four weeks. People who were temporarily laid off from a job were also classified as unemployed. A separate CPS variable specifying whether an unemployed person had worked before or was looking for a first job was used to distinguish between \"experienced\" and \"inexperienced\" unemployed persons in IPUMS CPS.\n",
